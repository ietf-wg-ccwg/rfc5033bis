              Specifying New Congestion Control Algorithms
                     draft-ietf-ccwg-rfc5033bis-02

Abstract

   The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown
   to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks,
   wireless technologies such as 3GPP and WiFi, long distance satellite
   links) and also in conflict with the needed, more isochronous,
   behaviors of VoIP, gaming, and videoconferencing traffic.  Recent
   research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that
   significantly differ from the IETF's congestion control principles.
   Using these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has
   possible ramifications to both the traffic using the new congestion
   control and to traffic using the currently standardized congestion
   control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing
   with alternate congestion control proposals.  The goal of this
   document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion
   control algorithms within the IETF.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides guidelines for the IETF to use when evaluating
   suggested congestion control algorithms that significantly differ
   from the general congestion control principles outlined in [RFC2914].
   The guidance is intended to be useful to authors proposing alternate
   congestion control and for the IETF community when evaluating whether
   a proposal is appropriate for publication in the RFC series and for
   deployment in the Internet.

   This document updates the similarly titled [RFC5033] that was
   published in 2007 as a Best Current Practice to evaluate new
   congestion control algorithms as Experimental or Proposed Standard
   RFCs.

   In 2007, TCP was the dominant consumer of this work, and proposals
   were typically discussed in research groups, for example the Internet
   Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG).

   Since RFC 5033 was published, many conditions have changed.  The set
   of protocols using these algorithms has spread beyond TCP and SCTP to
   include DCCP, QUIC, and beyond.  Some congestion control algorithm
   proponents now have the opportunity to test and deploy at scale
   without IETF review.  There is more interest in specialized use cases
   such as data centers and real-time protocols.  Finally, the community
   has gained much more experience with indications of congestion beyond
   packet loss.

   Multiple congestion control algorithms have been developed outside of
   the IETF, including at least two that saw large scale deployment:
   Cubic [HRX08] and BBR [BBR-draft].

   Cubic was documented in a research publication in 2007 [HRX08], and
   then adopted as the default congestion control algorithm for the TCP
   implementation in Linux.  It was already used in a significant
   fraction of TCP connections over the Internet before being documented
   in an informational Internet Draft in 2015, being published as an
   informational RFC in 2017 [RFC8312] and then as a proposed standard
   in 2023 [RFC9438].

   BBR is developed as an internal research project by Google, with the
   first implementation contributed to Linux kernel 4.19 in 2016.  It
   was described in an IRTF draft in 2018, and that draft is regularly
   updated to document the evolving versions of the algorithm
   [BBR-draft].  BBR is widely used for Google services using either TCP
   or QUIC [RFC9000], and is also largely deployed outside of Google.

   We cannot say now whether the original authors of [RFC5033] expected
   that developers would be somehow waiting for IETF review before
   widely deploying a congestion control algorithm over the Internet,
   but the examples of Cubic and BBR teaches us that deployment of new
   algorithms is not in fact gated by publication of the algorithm as an
   RFC.  Nevertheless, guidelines are important, if only to remind
   potential inventors and developers of the multiple facets of the
   congestion control problem.

   The guidelines in this document are intended to be consistent with
   the congestion control principles from [RFC2914] of preventing
   congestion collapse, considering fairness, and optimizing the flow's
   own performance in terms of throughput, delay, and loss.  [RFC2914]
   also discusses the goal of avoiding a congestion control "arms race"
   among competing transport protocols.

   This document does not give hard-and-fast requirements for an
   appropriate congestion control scheme.  Rather, the document provides
   a set of criteria that should be considered and weighed by the
   developers of congestion control algorithms and by the IETF in the
   context of each proposal.  The high-order criteria for any new
   proposal is that a serious scientific study of the pros and cons of
   the proposal needs to have been done before a proposal is considered
   for publication by the IETF or before it is deployed at large scale.

   After initial studies, we encourage authors to write a specification
   of their proposals for publication in the RFC series to allow others
   to concretely understand and investigate the wealth of proposals in
   this space.

2.  Document Status

   Following the lead of HighSpeed TCP [RFC3649], alternate congestion
   control algorithms are expected to be published as "Experimental"
   RFCs until such time that the community better understands the
   solution space.  Traditionally, the meaning of "Experimental" status
   has varied in its use and interpretation.  As part of this document
   we define two classes of congestion control proposals that can be
   published with the "Experimental" status.  The first class includes
   algorithms that are judged to be safe to deploy for best-effort
   traffic in the global Internet and further investigated in that
   environment.  The second class includes algorithms that, while
   promising, are not deemed safe enough for widespread deployment as
   best-effort traffic on the Internet, but are being specified to
   facilitate investigations in simulation, testbeds, or controlled
   environments.  The second class can also include algorithms where the
   IETF does not yet have sufficient understanding to decide if the
   algorithm is or is not safe for deployment on the Internet.

   Each alternate congestion control algorithm published is required to
   include a statement in the abstract indicating whether or not the
   proposal is considered safe for use on the Internet.  Each alternate
   congestion control algorithm published is also required to include a
   statement in the abstract describing environments where the protocol
   is not recommended for deployment.  There may be environments where
   the protocol is deemed _safe_ for use, but still is not _recommended_
   for use because it does not perform well for the user.

   As examples of such statements, [RFC3649] specifying HighSpeed TCP
   includes a statement in the abstract stating that the proposal is
   Experimental, but may be deployed in the current Internet.  In
   contrast, the Quick-Start document [RFC4782] includes a paragraph in
   the abstract stating the mechanism is only being proposed for
   controlled environments.  The abstract specifies environments where
   the Quick-Start request could give false positives (and therefore
   would be unsafe for incremental deployment where some routers
   forward, but do not process the option).  The abstract also specifies
   environments where packets containing the Quick-Start request could
   be dropped in the network; in such an environment, Quick-Start would
   not be unsafe to deploy, but deployment would not be recommended
   because it could lead to unnecessary delays for the connections
   attempting to use Quick-Start.  The Quick-Start method is discussed
   as an example in [RFC9049].

   For authors of alternate congestion control schemes who are not ready
   to bring their congestion control mechanisms to the IETF for
   standardization (either as Experimental or as Proposed Standard), one
   possibility would be to submit an internet-draft that documents the
   alternate congestion control mechanism for the benefit of the IETF
   and IRTF communities.  This is particularly encouraged in order to
   ensure algorithm specifications are widely disseminated to facilitate
   further research.  Such an internet-draft could also be considered as
   an Informational RFC, as a first step in the process towards
   standardization.  Such a document would be expected to carry an
   explicit warning against using the scheme in the global Internet.

   Note: we are not changing the RFC publication process for non-IETF
   produced documents (e.g., those from the IRTF or Independent
   Submissions via the RFC-Editor).  However, we would hope the
   guidelines in this document inform the IESG as they consider whether
   to add a note to such documents.

3.  Evaluation Criteria

   As noted above, authors are expected to do a well-rounded evaluation
   of the pros and cons of proposals brought to the IETF.  The following
   are guidelines to help authors and the IETF community.  Concerns that
   fall outside the scope of these guidelines are certainly possible;
   these guidelines should not be considered as an all-encompassing
   check-list.

   When considering a new congestion control proposal, the community
   MUST consider the following criteria.  These criteria will be
   evaluated in various domains (see Section 4 and Section 5).

3.1.  Single Algorithm Behavior

   The following criteria evaluate the proposed algorithm when one or
   more flows using that algorithm share a bottleneck link, with no
   other algorithms operating.

3.1.1.  Protection Against Congestion Collapse

   The alternate congestion control mechanism should either stop sending
   when the packet drop rate exceeds some threshold [RFC3714], or should
   include some notion of "full backoff".  For "full backoff", at some
   point the algorithm would reduce the sending rate to one packet per
   round-trip time and then exponentially backoff the time between
   single packet transmissions if congestion persists.  Exactly when
   either "full backoff" or a pause in sending comes into play will be
   algorithm-specific.  However, as discussed in [RFC2914], this
   requirement is crucial to protect the network in times of extreme
   congestion.

   If the result of full backoff is used, this test does not require
   that the full backoff mechanism must be identical to that of TCP
   [RFC2988].  As an example, this bullet does not preclude full backoff
   mechanisms that would give flows with different round- trip times
   comparable capacity during backoff.

3.1.2.  Protection Against Bufferbloat

   The alternate congestion control mechanism should reduce its sending
   rate if the round trip time (RTT) significantly increases.  Exactly
   how the algorithm reduces its sending rate is algorithm specific, but
   see [RFC8961] and [RFC8085] for requirements.

   Bufferbloat [Bufferbloat] refers to the building of long queues in
   the network.  Many network routers are configured with very large
   buffers.  If congestion starts happening, classic TCP congestion
   control algorithms [RFC5681] will continue sending at a high rate
   until the buffer fills up completely and packet losses occur.  Every
   connection going through that bottleneck will experience high
   latency.  This adds unwanted latency that impacts highly interactive
   applications like games, but it also affects routine web browsing and
   video playing.

   This problem became apparent in the last decade and was not discussed
   in the Congestion Control Principles published in September 2002
   [RFC2914].  The classic congestion control algorithm [RFC5681] and
   the widely deployed Cubic algorithm [RFC9438] do not address it, but
   newly designed congestion control algorithms have the opportunity to
   improve the state of the art.

3.1.3.  Fairness within the Alternate Congestion Control Algorithm.

   When multiple competing flows all using the same alternate congestion
   control algorithm, the proposal should explore how the capacity is
   shared among the competing flows.

3.1.4.  Short Flows

   (TODO: Discuss short and long flows)

3.2.  Mixed Algorithm Behavior

   These criteria evaluate the interaction of the proposal with commonly
   deployed congestion controls.

3.2.1.  Existing General-Purpose Transports

   Evaluate the impact on TCP [RFC9293], SCTP [RFC9260], DCCP [RFC4340],
   and QUIC [RFC9000].

   Proposed congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated when
   competing with standard IETF congestion control [RFC5681], [RFC9260],
   [RFC4340], [RFC9002], [RFC9438].  Alternate congestion controllers
   that have a significantly negative impact on traffic using standard
   congestion control may be suspect and this aspect should be part of
   the community's decision making with regards to the suitability of
   the alternate congestion control mechanism.  The community should
   also consider other non-standard congestion controls known to be
   widely deployed,

   We note that this bullet is not a requirement for strict Reno- or
   Cubic- friendliness as a prerequisite for an alternate congestion
   control mechanism to advance to Experimental.  As an example,
   HighSpeed TCP is a congestion control mechanism that is Experimental,
   but that is not TCP-friendly in all environments.  When a new
   algorithm is deployed, the existing major deployments need to be
   considered to avoid severe performance degradation.  We also note
   that this guideline does not constrain the interaction with non-best-
   effort traffic.

   As an example from an Experimental RFC, fairness with standard TCP is
   discussed in Sections 4 and 6 of [RFC3649] (HighSpeed TCP) and using
   spare capacity is discussed in Sections 6, 11.1, and 12 of [RFC3649].

3.2.2.  Real-Time Protocols

   (TODO: Clarify that real time congestion controls are included, with
   allowances for the poor documentation / open source availability of
   these)

3.2.3.  Short and Long Flows

   (TODO: Discuss short and long flows)

3.3.  Other Criteria

3.3.1.  Differences with Congestion Control Principles

   Proposed congestion control mechanisms SHOULD include a clear
   explanation of the deviations from [RFC2914].

3.3.2.  Incremental Deployment.

   The proposal should discuss whether the alternate congestion control
   mechanism allows for incremental deployment in the targeted
   environment.  For a mechanism targeted for deployment in the current
   Internet, it would be helpful for the proposal to discuss what is
   known (if anything) about the correct operation of the mechanism with
   some of the equipment installed in the current Internet, e.g.,
   routers, transparent proxies, WAN optimizers, intrusion detection
   systems, home routers, and the like.

   As a similar concern, if the alternate congestion control mechanism
   is intended only for specific environments (and not the global
   Internet), the proposal should consider how this intention is to be
   carried out.  The community will have to address the question of
   whether the scope can be enforced by simply stating the restrictions
   or whether additional protocol mechanisms are required to enforce the
   scoping.  The answer will necessarily depend on the change being
   proposed.

   As an example from an Experimental RFC, deployment issues are
   discussed in Sections 10.3 and 10.4 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).

4.  General Use

   The criteria in Section 3 will be evaluated in the following
   scenarios.  Unless a proposal is explicitly forbidden on the public
   internet, the community MUST find that it meets the criteria in these
   scenarios for the proposal to progress.

   The evaluation in each scenario should occur over a representative
   range of bandwidths, delays, and queue depths.  Of course, the set of
   parameters representative of the public internet will change over
   time.

   These criteria are meant to capture a statistically dominant set of
   internet conditions.  In the case that the algorithm has been tested
   at internet scale, the results from that deployment are often useful
   for answering these questions.

4.1.  Wired Networks

   (TODO: Describe properties of wired networks.)

   Proposals should be investigated for robust performance with
   different queueing mechanisms in the routers, especially Random Early
   Detection (RED) [FJ03] and Drop-Tail.  This evaluation is often not
   included in the internet-draft itself, but in related papers cited in
   the draft.

4.2.  Wireless networks

   While the early Internet was dominated by wired links, the properties
   of wireless links have become extremely important to Internet
   performance.  In particular, congestion controllers should be
   evaluated in situations where some packet losses are due to radio
   effects, rather than router queue drops; the link capacity varies
   over time due to changing link conditions; and media access delays
   and link-layer retransmission lead to increased jitter in round-trip
   times.  See [RFC3819] and Section 16 of [Tools] for further
   discussion of wireless properties.

5.  Special Cases

   The criteria in Section 3 will be evaluated in the following
   scenarios, unless the proposal specifically excludes its use in a
   scenario.  The community MAY allow a proposal to progress even if the
   criteria indicate an unsatisfactory result for these scenarios.

   In general, measurements from internet-scale deployments will not
   expose the properties of operation in these scenarios, as they are
   statistically small.

5.1.  Internet of Things

   (TODO: Write this section)

5.2.  Satellite

   Satellite links often have delays longer than typical for wired paths
   [RFC2488] and high delay bandwidth products [RFC3649].

5.3.  Misbehaving Nodes

   The proposal should explore how the alternate congestion control
   mechanism performs with non-compliant senders, receivers, or routers.
   In addition, the proposal should explore how the alternate congestion
   control mechanism performs with outside attackers.  This can be
   particularly important for congestion control mechanisms that involve
   explicit feedback from routers along the path.

   As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance with misbehaving
   nodes and outside attackers is discussed in Sections 9.4, 9.5, and
   9.6 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).  This includes discussion of
   misbehaving senders and receivers; collusion between misbehaving
   routers; misbehaving middleboxes; and the potential use of Quick-
   Start to attack routers or to tie up available Quick-Start bandwidth.

5.4.  Tunnel Behavior

   When the proposal relies on explicit signals from the path, the
   effect of traffic passing through the tunnel -- where routers may not
   be aware of the underlying flow -- MUST be considered.

5.5.  Extreme Packet Reordering

   [RFC4653] discusses the effect of extreme packet reordering.

5.6.  Transient Events

   The proposal should consider how the alternate congestion control
   mechanism would perform in the presence of transient events such as
   sudden congestion, a routing change, or a mobility event.  Routing
   changes, link disconnections, intermittent link connectivity, and
   mobility are discussed in more detail in Section 17 of [Tools].

   As an example from an Experimental RFC, response to transient events
   is discussed in Section 9.2 of [RFC4782] (Quick-Start).

5.6.1.  Sudden changes in Path

   An IETF transport is not tied to a specific Internet path.  The set
   of routers forming a path can and do change with time, this will also
   cause the properties of the path to change with respect to time.  New
   CCs MUST evaluate the impact of changes in the path, and be robust to
   changes in path characteristics on the interval of common Internet
   re-routing intervals.

   Event when the routers constituting a path does not change, the
   properties of that path can vary, with similar impacts on congestion
   control

5.7.  Multipath

   Multipath transport protocols permit more than one path to be
   differentiated and used by a single connection at the sender.  A
   multipath sender can schedule which packets travel on which of its
   active paths.  This enables a tradeoff in timeliness and reliability.

   One use is to provide fail-over from one path to another when the
   original path is no longer viable or to switch the traffic from one
   path to another when this is expected to improve performance
   (latency, throughput, reliability, cost).  Designs need to
   independently track the congestion state of each path, and need to
   demonstrate independent congestion control for each path being used.
   New multipath CCs that implement path fail-over MUST evaluate the
   harm resulting from a change in the path, and show that this does not
   result in flow starvation.  Synchronisation of failover (e.g., where
   multiple flows change their path on similar timeframes) can also
   contribute to harm and/or reduce fairness, these effects also ought
   to be evaluated.

   A concurrent multipath transport protocol simultaneously schedules
   flows to aggregate the capacity across multiple paths.  The Internet
   provides no guarantee that different paths (e.g., using different
   endpoint addresses) are disjoint.  This has additional implications:
   New CCs MUST evaluate the potential harm to other flows when the
   multiple paths share a common congested bottleneck (or share
   resources that are coupled between different paths, such as an
   overall capacity limit), and SHOULD consider the fairness with other
   flows.  Synchronisation of CC mechanisms (e.g., where multiple flows
   change their behaviour on similar timeframes) can also contribute to
   harm and/or reduce fairness, these effects also ought to be
   evaluated.  At the time of writing, there are no IETF standards for
   concurrent multipath congestion control in the general Internet.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not represent a change to any aspect of the TCP/IP
   protocol suite and therefore does not directly impact Internet
   security.  The implementation of various facets of the Internet's
   current congestion control algorithms do have security implications
   (e.g., as outlined in [RFC5681]).  Alternate congestion control
   schemes should be mindful of such pitfalls, as well, and should
   examine any potential security issues that may arise.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Acknowledgments

   Sally Floyd and Mark Allman were the authors of this document's
   predecessor, RFC5033, which served the community well for over a
   decade.

   Thanks to Richard Scheffenegger for helping to get this revision
   process started.

   Discussions with Lars Eggert and Aaron Falk seeded the original
   RFC5033.  Bob Briscoe, Gorry Fairhurst, Doug Leith, Jitendra Padhye,
   Colin Perkins, Pekka Savola, members of TSVWG, and participants at
   the TCP Workshop at Microsoft Research all provided feedback and
   contributions to that document.  It also drew from [RFC5166].

   These individuals suggested improvements to this document:
