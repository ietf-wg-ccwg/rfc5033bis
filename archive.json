But these are only two points in the spectrum of things that can be done. For example, in various QUIC implementations, I have also seen:\r\n\r\n* multipath of ACK -- using the lowest latency path to carry ACKs for the other paths,\r\n* multipath of loss recovery -- resending the content of packets lost on path A on the hopefully more reliable path B,\r\n* multipath redundancy -- sending duplicate traffic on path A and B, so the receiver can pick whichever arrives first,\r\n* multipath redundancy with FEC -- same as above, but send FEC redundancy instead of merely duplicating traffic,\r\n* multipath affinity -- subsets of application traffic are tied to a specific path as long as that path is available.\r\n\r\nNot all of these have obvious congestion control consequences, but some do. For example:\r\n\r\n* Multipath of ACK is widely implemented, and the draft multipath specifically supports it. It is particularly useful when one of the links is high bandwidth and high latency. But then, this means the multipath connection will enjoy a shorter RTT than the other connections sharing the same bottleneck, which generally results in a larger share of the capacity.\r\n\r\n* Multipath redundancy was pioneered by the QUIC team at Ali-Baba, as a way to get lower latency when sending video streams. They do that when one of the paths is considered a bit suspect. Of course, it leads to using more bandwidth.\r\n\r\n",

And to answer the direct question from @martinduke, \"no worse than Cubic\" is not an acceptable bar.\r\n\r\nI can see different congestion control algorithms reacting to three kinds of feedback: packet losses, delay increases, and ECN marks. IMHO, modern algorithms should react to all three. There is a tricky part there because all three signals are subject to some amount of noise: we observe non-congestion losses and delay jitter on some wireless links, and with L4S we will observe some ECN marks before congestion is significant. That's why we probably need to speak about frequency, and state that congestion control algorithms should back off if they observe significant increase in the frequency of packet losses, increase of the RTT, or increase in the frequency of ECN marks.\r\n\r\nThe bufferbloat issue is particularly evident during slow-start or start-up. The good news there is that Hystart++ does a pretty good job of backing off before causing actual congestion. BBRv2 is almost there too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The classic fairness evaluation derives from the equation about asymptotic behavior drawn by Matt Mathis, which end up requiring a non linear response to the frequency of a control signal such as packet loss or ECN marks. There are of course two problems. First, time scale, because many connections don't last long enough to approach asymptotic behavior. Second, scaling, as discussed for example in RFC3649. If an algorithm requires ever increasing spacing between control events to sustain larger data rates, then the control loop becomes very long, or, in the case of packet losses very noisy as \"true\" control events get intermixed with random losses.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, algorithms with linear response scale very well, but do not naturally provide fairness. Which is kind of a bummer, and also a research topic. I think the Bis draft will have to recognize that tension somehow, and encourage experimentation.",

This comes with both strengths and weaknesses - it can reduce collateral damage to other flows; but it also can motivate the use of additional flows to gain additional network resource. \r\n\r\n* Transport proposals need to be evaluate and avoid inducing flow starvation to the other flows that share resources along the path they use.\r\n* Transports proposals need to be evaluate and ensure they treat a loss of all feedback (e.g., expiry of a retransmission time out) as an indication of persistent congestion.",

Including having actual subsections per issue, rather than the current list format.\r\n\r\nTwo points: short flows, and transient events.\r\n\r\nShort flows are pretty much the norm, with reports of 90% of connections never going out of slow start. There is an associated problem: capacity discovery algorithm like slow start will rapidly increase the amount of data sent on a path, with a high potential for disrupting current users of that path. That's not good. There are potentials solutions such as quickly evaluating the capacity (e.g., packet pair, squirting, variants), remembering past connections (careful resume), or potentially getting input from the network (maybe something like Prague/ECN). These solutions have been explored for \"special\" links (satellite, deep space), but the problem is not just special links. I would like to see that discussed in the \"main\" section (A).\r\n\r\nTransients are also the norm. Congestion control is a form of control algorithm, and control algorithms must absolutely deal with transients. For example, if we deal with wireless, we need to deal with \"entering a tunnel\" -- and exiting. We may want to deal with [some of the silliness performed in the name of energy saving](https://www.privateoctopus.com/2023/05/18/the-weird-case-of-wifi-latency-spikes.html).

I suspect we also have these \"variable delays\" in satellite services, especially when using constellations of low orbit satellites.\r\n\r\nThe state of the art is not very good. BBR for example recognizes its dependency on accurate estimate of the min RTT, but has to resort to some kind of periodic reset if measurements of RTT kept over RTT min for 10 seconds -- which is both quite long for some apps, and quite annoying for real time apps suffering a transmission issue every ten seconds.

This occurs when a subnet changes the forwarding path to optimise capacity, resilience, etc. It could also arise when a subnet uses a capacity management method where the available resource is periodically distributed among the active nodes and where a node might then have to buffer data until an assigned transmission opportunity. Variation also results when a higher priority diffserv traffic classic prompts the transmission by a lower class. In these cases, the delay varies as a function of external factors and attempting to infer congestion from an increase in the delay results in reduced throughput.",

Most mulitcast deployments are done in controlled environments however, with [Automatic Multicast Tunneling] (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7450/) multicast traffic these days have more probability to occur across links where this traffic would share bottlenecks with other unicast traffic. However, this amount of traffic is still normally bit-rate bound so it might be considered just in-elastic and consuming the bit-rate it does. \r\n\r\nI also want to state that I am fine with declaring multicast out of scope, but maybe some information about that there exist algorithms should be includeded in the draft.

Some loss recovery algorithms detect packet losses too soon and try to repeat packets that were not actually lost -- an example wold be algorithms relying on fixed timers. Other algorithms respond to the loss of one packet by sending many packets -- an example would be algorithms repeating whole messages if one of the packets carrying the message is lost. Such algorithms create additional traffic overhead during congestion periods, and thus increase the risk of congestion collapse. The Internet congestion events of the late 1980's were likely amplified by those two factors: TCP then did not properly compute retransmission timers [cite Lixia's paper] and reacted to packet losses by repeating all packets in flight, using a \"Go Back N\" strategy. Modern packet loss recover methods avoid these pitfalls, see [cite the RACK RFC].\"",

Makes sense to separate it.\r\n\r\nHowever, the L4S folks have introduced a tight coupling between a very specific use of ECN in the L4S AQM, and a fine grain mandate of the expected behavior of the CCA. And I cringe each time I read their dual queue formula based on the asymptotic limit of Reno -- but not Cubic. I wish we could walk that back, or describe it in more neutral terms. With L4S, ECT(1) is a signal from the sending host to the network that CE marks should be apply at incipient congestion, instead of waiting for actual loss-generating queue buildup as in RFC 3168. Maybe that should be true even for algorithms that are not described in L4S.\r\n\r\nOf course, we have to deal with what we have. Maybe we should just quote all the relevant RFCs, and denote the difference between ECT(1)/EC and ECT(0)/EC. Senders using ECT(1) should consider that the rate of CE marking signals the intensity of the congestion, while senders using ECT(0) should consider individual CE marks as denoting actual congestion.

Nevertheless, guidelines are important, if only to remind potential inventors and developers of the multiple facets of the congestion control problem.\r\n\r\nThe above text says guidelines for specifications are important, but such guidelines only make sense if there is a specification in the first place.\r\nSo I wonder if it's worth saying a few words here about why it's useful to specify/standardize congestion control algorithms.\r\n\r\nA few thoughts on the benefits of specifying congestion control algorithms:\r\n- Help get a shared understanding between implementers, operators, and other interested parties of how the algorithm works and how it is expected to behave (or explicit discussion of parameters and such which can lead to differences in behavior)\r\n- As a result of the shared understanding:\u202fMake it easier for anyone, not just the initial proponents or main implementers, to point out current issues/limitations or suggest improvements  of a spec that is still in development, and make it easier to converge such changes to a consensus behavior\r\n\r\nThere may be more benefits. \r\nThough I wonder how to best capture the nuance of \"Some documentation or artifacts are better than nothing, but an actual spec is better than just a snapshot for documentation or artifacts\".\r\n\r\nDo people think it'll be useful to add something along these lines to the document?",

      "body": "1. General:\r\n\r\nIn some places, a new proposed congestion control algorithm that this document addresses is repeatedly called \"The alternate congestion control algorithm\".\r\nIn some places, it's repeatedly called \"A proposed congestion control algorithm\".\r\nIn some places, it's repeatedly called \"The proposal\u201d.\r\nIn some places, it\u2019s called \u201cNew CCs\u201d  (only in a few places - else the abbreviation CC isn\u2019t introduced).\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to unify this. My suggestion: mixing \u201cThe proposal\u201d and \u201cA proposed congestion control algorithm\u201d doesn\u2019t really matter, but \u201cThe alternative congestion control algorithm\u201d stands out - I would replace these occurrences with \u201cThe proposed congestion control algorithm\u201d, and replace \u201cNew CCs\u201d in the same way.\r\n\r\n2. Section 1 Intro:\r\nOLD:\r\nIn 2007, TCP was the dominant consumer of this work, and proposals were typically discussed in research groups, for example the Internet Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG).\r\nNEW:\r\nIn 2007, TCP was the dominant consumer of this work, and proposals were typically discussed in the Internet Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG).\r\nREASON:\r\nI don\u2019t remember seeing any other proposal being discussed in any other RG.\r\n- accepted\r\n\r\n***\r\n3. Since RFC 5033 was published, many conditions have changed.\r\nThe set of protocols using these algorithms has spread beyond\r\nTCP and SCTP to include DCCP, QUIC, and beyond.\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe DCCP RFCs pre-date RFC 5033, and so I find it a bit odd to see it mentioned in this context. On the other hand, the problem that this text is about is largely related to the deployment of cc. mechanisms without first getting an OK from the IETF, and so it fits to talk about QUIC which is mostly written in user space. Similarly, it would fit to talk about the RMCAT CC\u2019s, or LEDBAT - much more, it seems to me, than to talk about DCCP. So, I suggest to instead say the \u201cWebRTC protocol suite\u201d or something like that.\r\n\r\n4. Section 3.1.2:\r\n***\r\nBufferbloat [Bufferbloat] refers to the building of long queues in the network. \r\n***\r\nI think the [Bufferbloat] reference should be replaced with a \u201cproper\u201d one with longer-term archival value, instead of pointing at the IETF blog. E.g., this:\r\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5755608 <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5755608>\r\nwhich is also freely available: https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2071893 <https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2071893>\r\n\r\n5. Section 3.2.1:\r\n***\r\nEvaluate the impact on TCP [RFC9293], SCTP [RFC9260], DCCP [RFC4340], and QUIC [RFC9000].\r\n***\r\nI would recommend to remove this. I find it odd: this is about the interaction between congestion control mechanisms, not transport protocols - why would there be a significant difference between running a mechanism against SCTP or TCP, for example? Indeed this is clarified in the next paragraph, which says: \"A proposed congestion control algorithm SHOULD be evaluated when competing with standard IETF congestion control [RFC5681], [RFC9260], [RFC4340], [RFC9002], [RFC9438].\u201d  - so why then list these protocols here?  (also: they seem strange to include as references in the sentence I mention here - instead, I would only cite RFC 5681 and RFC 9438).\r\nIt seems to me that listing the actual protocols expects a proponent of a new mechanism to carry out a huge amount of actually rather useless work.\r\n\r\nBesides, DCCP is an odd one in this list, because evaluating the impact \u201con it\u201d would mean to also evaluate against TFRC and TFRC-SP. Seriously, at this time and day? Is anyone using these controls, still, in any context?\r\n(technically, RMCAT controls and LEDBAT would make more sense IMO, but I think it\u2019s ok to skip them because they\u2019re all Experimental).\r\n\r\n6.\r\nI would swap section 4.1 on tunnel behavior with section 4.2 on paths with Tail-drop Queues, because the latter is the more common case. No big deal, but it\u2019s just a strange sequence IMO.\r\n\r\n7. Section 5.7.1:\r\n***\r\nNew CCs MUST evaluate the impact of changes in the path, and be robust\r\nto changes in path characteristics on the interval of common Internet re-routing intervals.\r\n***\r\nFirst, I don\u2019t think that the abbreviation \u201cCC\u201d has been used before. it is also later used in section 5.8 - I suggest to fix this, to be uniform.\r\n\r\n8. Issue:\r\n\r\nMore importantly though, the beginning of Section 5 says, about the whole section, that \u201cThe community MAY allow a proposal to progress even if the criteria indicate an unsatisfactory result for these scenarios.\u201d\r\nThis seems to collide with the \u201cMUST\u201d above.\r\n\r\n9. I have the same concern about the two MUSTs in section 5.8, \r\n10. and there, also, we have the use of \u201cCC\u201d.\r\n",

This all falls back into the general \"fairness\" issue, for which we also no not have consensus beyond the minimal recommendation to not starve the competition.\r\n\r\nInstead of focusing on fairness, I would be tempted to look at selfish motives. Suppose the connection is the sole user of the bottleneck, and somehow splits its traffic as a set of paths through that bottleneck. Does it cause unexpected effects, like maybe building larger queues or incurring larger losses?\r\n\r\nBut for a first attempt, I would trim the proposed text a lot, removing everything after \"demonstrate independent congestion control for each path being used.\"",

              "body": "I think this is all too long, and mixes two or three different concepts:\r\n\r\n1) that routing change happen, and that congestion control need to be ready for such changes.\r\n\r\n2) that transport protocols managing different paths should manage congestion independently for each path.\r\n\r\n3) that even when paths are defined by different pairs of addresses, there is a possibility that these paths share some common congested segments.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration is not really about multipath, and in my mind should be pulled into its own subsection.\r\n\r\nThere is some consensus about \"measuring the congestion for each path\", by opposition to \"measuring the congestion control for a bundle paths\", which could cause congestion on the lowest capacity path of the bundle. This is summarized in TCPM (section 3.3.7 of RFC 8684) as \"we mean that it does not take up more capacity on any one path than if it was a single path flow using only that route, so this ensures fair coexistence with single-path TCP at shared bottlenecks.\" There is a similar point in QUIC (Section 9.4 RFC 9000) and in the QUIC Multipath draft (Section 7.2. of draft-ietf-quic-multipath), \"When the QUIC multipath extension is used, senders manage per-path congestion status as required in Section 9.4 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].\"\r\n\r\nThe third point about common segments is touching into research issues. If the different paths share a common segment, we may want to do something, but what? The easy solution is that if N path share the same segment, the effect on other users must not be worse than if N independent connections shared this segment. Which is of course a low bar. But then, detecting that paths do in fact share segments is a bit of a research issue. Yes, we have a coupled congestion control algorithm specified in RFC 6356, but this is an experimental RFC, which mean we cannot really mandate its use.",

So, for (1) we should definitely evaluate relative performance with path changes.\r\n\r\nFor (2) I definitely know what you both mean, but I'm having trouble thinking about how to frame this in a usable way. What if a congestion control looked at the relative state of two paths and made a path decision based on that? What if Path A and B share the same bottleneck -- isn't coupling reasonable then? What is the testable assertion here? Perhaps \"vary path B  state and show that path A throughput is unchanged,\" but what are we hoping to gain from that? I am creeping towards the idea that we don't want to say anything about this at all, though I can certainly be persuaded otherwise.\r\n\r\n(3) There are zero standard concurrent multipath congestion controls at this time. We may not be able to say anything, but it would certainly be nice if the community could converge on something here. Strict fairness over a  shared bottleneck sits poorly with our theme of moving away from fairness to starvation. So is it OK for an algorithm to have 3 convergent paths and thus take 3/4 of the bandwidth there?\r\n\r\n",

But I would not describe the cause of the collapse as \"increased overhead\" -- unless we get a rather all-encompassing definition of overhead.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the collapse was that excess traffic was causing queues, queues were causing the pre-1988 timers to fire, and TCP was immediately resending all the \"lost\" packets using a Go-back N strategy. In theory, that should only have affected the queue at a bottleneck, but in practice the excess traffic caused queues in nodes between senders and bottleneck, thus propagating the gridlock. It was nasty.\r\n\r\nWhat got us out of that mess was of course Van Jacobson's congestion control algorithm, and also the work on improved TCP timers. But the principle behind that was \"if the conditions are bad, nodes should reduce their traffic, not increase it.\"\r\n",

It kinds of dilute the \"harm and starve\" message.\r\n\r\nAlso, the state of the art is murky, because few deployments can actually ensure fair sharing, especially if different flows are experiencing different RTT. Today, we have:\r\n\r\n* Reno: flows get shares inversely proportional to their RTT.\r\n* Cubic: lots of efforts to ensure equal shares independently of RTT, but I have no particular experience with how good they do.\r\n* BBR: flows get share. If you wait 10 seconds, competitors will learn the actual RTT, and sharing will be a bit more fair.\r\n\r\nGetting better shares for small RTT may be unavoidable. Hosts with short RTT will track the state of the path more closely and react faster than hosts with long RTT. It may also be what the network wants: local flows get more bandwidth; their faster reaction implies a better network utilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

That's not necessarily what I would have written.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, Hystart is about trying to detect the bottleneck CWIN without incurring packet losses, by stopping exponential growth when a delay increase is detected. This is a great idea, but it turns out that it can \"stop too soon\" if delay increases happen that are not due to congestion. Hystart++ tries to mitigate that by not going immediately into \"congestion avoidance\" after the first delay increase, but instead going to a \"more cautious exponential growth\" . So Hystart++ is actually a bit more aggressive than the original Hystart...\r\n\r\nNot that I have a better way to say that...",

For example, you *could* do DNS over TCP by opening a separate TCP connection for each DNS transaction. That would be bad, because each transaction remains under IW10, and thus the multiple TCP connections are never regulated by congestion control.\r\n\r\n2) In contrast, many short flows never send enough data to saturate the bottleneck, and thus always send at a rate lower than the path capacity. They are not aggressive enough.\r\n\r\nThe solution to the second issue is either to convince developers to move to a model a single connection, or to be much better at quickly ramping up single flow connections. Something like the \"careful resume\" work. ",

Increased delays are a sign of congestion. But that's not always the case. In mobile networks, a station may well move to a different cell. The delay may be longer, if the new base station is further away, or needs to poll more clients. The data rate may or may not be lower, depending of frequencies and bandwidth available. The old logic breaks.",

The two main complications are: (1) The time to respond is not related to the traffic load: it is a function of the link RTT, and the allocation interval (often related to the super frame size in the systems I know of), but also dependent on the design of the method ... these have nothing to do with the queue occupancy (2) The available capacity from the resource pool depends on what can be used by the specific system ... which may be a subset of the total resource ... and also the load on that resource by other systems, propagation conditions, implemented waveforms, etc.\r\n\r\nIn short: when there is a queue, I see dynamic capacity assignment can cause delay, but the length of the delay is a function of an external control system, not the level of congestion for the flow - i.e. the delay can be transient and have no bearing on the availability of capacity next RTT. Whereas, for a FIFO queue, the queueing delay can have a strong correlation with the availability of capacity next RTT.",

Often this is a long-term measurement that can be made by app, if one understands the other flows, i.e.e, once algorithms have converged. e.g. For a web client: One could in principle do this by showing that if there are N flows, a flow converges to 1/N of capacity...\r\nStarvation on the other hand  is about the effect a flow has on a different flow. I think it may only be relevent when you have a different algorithm or type of traffic. Starvation really is much harder to evaluate in a practical measurement, because it concerns whether the flow has the effect of disrupting another flow so that it does significantly worse  (more harm) than flow that would expect. A web client typically does not know if it's CC behaviour disrupts a different multimedia transfer's timing, (unless you dig into the data for that other application (the other sharing flow), which might be with a different IP address/user.\r\n\r\nNow I'm not sure this is so clear, in our current text, but we might perjaps need to think in terms of fairness of algorithms to traffic using the method, and harm to other traffic using other algorithms.",
