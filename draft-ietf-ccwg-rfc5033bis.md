--- abstract

Introducing new or modified congestion control algorithms in the global Internet has
possible ramifications to both the flows using the proposed congestion control algorithms
and to flows using a standardized congestion control algorithm. Therefore, the IETF
must proceed with caution when evaluating proposals for alternate congestion control.
The goal of this document is to provide guidance for considering standardization
of a proposed congestion control algorithm at the IETF. It obsoletes RFC5033 to reflect
changes in the congestion control landscape.

# Introduction

This document provides guidelines for the IETF to use when evaluating
a proposed congestion control algorithm that differ
from the general congestion control principles outlined in {{!RFC2914}}.
The guidance is intended to be useful to authors proposing
congestion control algorithms and for the IETF community when evaluating whether
a proposal is appropriate for publication in the RFC series and for
deployment in the Internet.

This document obsoletes {{?RFC5033}}, which was
published in 2007 as a Best Current Practice to evaluate proposed
congestion control algorithms as Experimental or Proposed Standard RFCs.

The IETF's standard congestion control algorithms have been shown to have
performance challenges in various environments
(e.g., high-speed networks, cellular and WiFi wireless technologies, and
long distance satellite links)
and also flows carrying specific workloads (Voice over IP (VoIP), gaming, and videoconferencing).

In 2007, TCP {{?RFC9293}} was the dominant consumer of this work, and proposals
were typically discussed in the Internet Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG).
The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) {{?RFC4340}}
was developed as a method for defining new congestion control algorithms for
datagram traffic.

Since {{?RFC5033}} was published, many conditions have changed.
The set of protocols using these algorithms has spread beyond
TCP, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) {{?RFC9260}}, and DCCP, to include QUIC {{?RFC9000}}, RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques (RMCAT) (e.g., {{?RFC8836}}) and beyond.

Some proponents of alternative congestion control algorithms now have the opportunity
to test and deploy at scale without IETF review.
There is more interest in specialized use cases, such as data centers (e.g., {{?RFC8257}}), and in
support for a variety of upper layer protocols/applications, e.g.,
real-time protocols.
Finally, the community has gained much more experience with indications
of congestion beyond packet loss.

Multicast congestion control is a considerably less mature field of study
and are not in scope for this document.
However, {{Section 4 of ?RFC8085}} provides
additional guidelines for multicast and broadcast usage of UDP.

Congestion control algorithms
have been developed outside of the IETF, including at least two that saw
large scale deployment: Cubic {{HRX08}}
and Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (BBR) {{BBR-draft}}.

Cubic was documented in a research publication in 2007 {{HRX08}},
and was then adopted as the default congestion control algorithm for
the TCP implementation in Linux. It was already used in a significant
fraction of TCP connections over the Internet before being documented
in an Informational Internet-Draft in 2015, published as an
Informational RFC in 2017 {{?RFC8312}} and then as a Proposed
Standard in 2023 {{?RFC9438}}.

BBR is developed as an internal research project by Google,
with the first implementation contributed to Linux kernel 4.19 in 2016.
It was described in an IRTF Internet-Draft in 2018, and that Internet-Draft is
regularly updated to document the evolving versions of the algorithm
{{BBR-draft}}. BBR is widely used for Google services using either
TCP or QUIC, and is also widely deployed outside of
Google.

We cannot say now whether the original authors of {{?RFC5033}}
expected that developers would be somehow waiting for IETF review
before widely deploying a new congestion control algorithm over the
Internet, but the examples of Cubic and BBR teach us that
deployment of new algorithms is not in fact gated by publication
of the algorithm as an RFC.

Nevertheless, specifying congestion control algorithms has a number of advantages:

- A specification can help implementers, operators, and other interested
  parties to develop a shared understanding of how the algorithm works and how
  it is expected to behave in various different scenarios or configurations.
- A specification can help potential contributors understand the algorithm,
  which can make it easier for them to suggest improvements and/or identify
  limitations. Furthermore, the specification can help multiple contributors align
  on a consensus change to the algorithm.
- A specification that is accessible to anyone circumvents the issue that some
  implementors may be unable to read open source reference implementations due
  to the constraints of some open source licenses.

Beyond helping develop specific algorithm proposals, guidelines can also serve
as a reminder to potential inventors and developers of the multiple facets of
the congestion control problem.

The evaluation guidelines in this document are intended to be consistent with
the congestion control principles from {{!RFC2914}} of preventing
congestion collapse, considering fairness, and optimizing a flow's
own performance in terms of throughput, delay, and loss.
{{!RFC2914}}
also discusses the goal of avoiding a congestion control "arms race"
among competing transport protocols.

This document does not give hard-and-fast requirements for an
appropriate congestion control algorithm.
Rather, the document provides
a set of criteria that should be considered and weighed by the
developers of alternative algorithms and by the IETF
in the context of each proposal.

The high-order criterion for advancing any proposal within the IETF
is a serious scientific study of the pros and cons that occur when the proposal is
considered for publication by the IETF or before it is deployed at
large scale.

After initial studies, authors are encouraged to write a specification
of their proposal for publication in the RFC series. This allows others
to understand and investigate the wealth of proposals in
this space.

This document is meant to reduce the barriers to entry for new congestion
control work to the IETF. As such, proponents ought not to interpret these criteria as a
checklist of requirements before approaching the IETF. Instead, proponents
are encouraged to think about these issues beforehand, and have the willingness
to do the work implied by the remainder of this document.

# Document Status

This document applies to proposed congestion control algorithms that seek Experimental or
Standards Track status. Evaluation of both cases involves the same questions,
but with different expectations for both the answers and the degree of
certainty of the answers.

Congestion control algorithms without experience of Internet-scale deployment SHOULD
seek Experimental status until real-world data is able to answer the questions
in {{general-use}}. Congestion control algorithms with a record of measured
Internet-scale deployment MAY directly seek the Standards Track if the community believes
it is safe, and the design is stable, guided by the considerations in
{{general-use}}. The existence of this data does not waive the other
considerations in this document.

Experimental specifications SHOULD NOT be deployed as a default. They SHOULD
only be deployed in situations where they are being actively measured, and where
it is possible to deactivate if there are signs of pathological behavior.

Each published congestion control algorithm is REQUIRED to include a
statement in the abstract indicating whether or not there is IETF consensus that
the proposed congestion control algorithm is considered safe for use on the Internet.
Each published algorithm
is also required to include a statement in the
abstract describing environments where the protocol is not recommended
for deployment. There can be environments where the congestion control
algorith is deemed *safe*
for use, but it is still is not *recommended* for use because it does not
perform well for the user.

As examples of such statements, {{?RFC3649}} specifying HighSpeed TCP
includes a statement in the abstract stating that the proposed congestion control algorithm is
Experimental, but may be deployed in the current Internet. In
contrast, the Quick-Start document {{?RFC4782}} includes a paragraph in
the abstract stating the mechanism is only being proposed for
use in controlled environments.  The abstract specifies environments where
the Quick-Start request could give false positives (and therefore
would be unsafe for incremental deployment where some routers
forward, but do not process the option). The abstract also specifies environments
where packets containing the Quick-Start request could be dropped in
the network; in such an environment, Quick-Start would not be unsafe
to deploy, but deployment would not be recommended because it
could lead to unnecessary delays for the connections attempting to use
Quick-Start. The Quick-Start method is discussed as an example in {{?RFC9049}}.

Alhough out of the scope of this document, a proponent of a new
algorithm could alternatively
seek publication as an Informational or Experimental RFC via the Internet
Research Task Force (IRTF).
In general, these algorithms are expected to be less
mature than ones that follow the procedures in this document. Authors documenting
deployed congestion control algorithms that cannot be changed by IETF or IRTF review
are invited to publish as an Informational RFC via the Independent Stream Editor
(ISE).

# Specifying Algorithms for use in Controlled Environments

Algorithms can be designed for general Internet deployment or for use in controlled environments.
An operator can ensure that flows within a controlled environment are isolated from other
Internet flows, or they might allow these flows to share resources with other Internet flows.
Algorithms that rely on specific functions or
configurations in a network need to provide a reference or specification for these functions
(an RFC or another stable specification).
The IETF will need to assess whether the relevant working group is able review the
proposed new algorithm and whether there is sufficient experience to
understand any dependent functions.

A data center is an example of a controlled environment, which often deploys fabrics with rich
signalling from switches to endpoints. Furthermore, an operator can often limit
the number of operating congestion controls.
Many data centers are characterized by very low latencies (< 2 ms) and can support
specific workloads (e.g., that introduce bursty traffic
where many nodes complete a task at the same time).

In evaluating a new proposal for use in a controlled environment {{?RFC8799}}, the IETF needs
to understand the usage, e.g., how the usage is scoped to the controlled environment,
whether the algorithm will share resources with Internet traffic
and consider what could happen if used in a protocol that is bridged across an Internet path.
Algorithms that are designed to be confined to a controlled environment
and are not intended for use in the general Internet,
might instead seek real-world data for those environments.
In such cases, the evaluation criteria in the remainder of this document might not apply.

# Evaluation Criteria {#evaluation-criteria}

As noted above, authors are expected to do a well-rounded evaluation
of the pros and cons of congestion control algorithms that are brought to the IETF.
The following guidelines are designed to help authors and the IETF community. Concerns that
fall outside the scope of these guidelines are certainly possible;
these guidelines should not be considered as an all-encompassing
check-list.

When considering a proposed congestion control algorithm, the community MUST
consider the following criteria. These criteria will be evaluated in various
domains (see {{general-use}} and {{special-cases}}).

## Single Algorithm Behavior

The criteria in this section evaluate the congestion control algorithm when one or more flows
using that algorithm share a bottleneck link (i.e. with no flows
using a differing congestion control algorithm).

### Protection Against Congestion Collapse

A congestion control algorithm should either stop
sending when the packet drop rate exceeds some threshold
{{?RFC3714}}, or should include some notion of "full backoff". For
"full backoff", at some point the algorithm would reduce the
sending rate to one packet per round-trip time and then
exponentially backoff the time between single packet
transmissions if the congestion persists.  Exactly when either "full
backoff" or a pause in sending comes into play will be
algorithm-specific.  However, as discussed in {{!RFC2914}} and {{!RFC8961}}, this
requirement is crucial to protect the network in times of extreme (persistent)
congestion.

If the result of full backoff is used, this test does not require that the
full backoff mechanism must be identical to that of TCP
{{?RFC2988}} {{!RFC8961}}.  As an example, this does not preclude full
backoff mechanisms that would give flows with different round-trip
times comparable capacity during backoff.

### Protection Against Bufferbloat

A congestion control algorithm should try to avoid maintaining
excessive queues in the network. Exactly how
the algorithm achieves this is algorithm-specific, but see
{{!RFC8961}} and {{!RFC8085}} for requirements.

Bufferbloat {{Bufferbloat}} refers to the building of excessive queues in
the network. Many network routers are configured with very large buffers.
The standards-track Reno {{!RFC5681}} and Cubic {{?RFC9438}} congestion control algorithms
send at progressively higher rates until a First-In First-Out
(FIFO) buffer completely fills, and packet losses then occur.
Every connection passing through that bottleneck experiences increased
latency due to the high buffer occupancy. This adds unwanted latency that
negatively impacts highly interactive applications like
videoconferencing or games, but it also affects routine
web browsing and video playing.

This problem has been widely discussed since 2011 {{Bufferbloat}} but was not discussed in
the Congestion Control Principles published in September 2002 {{!RFC2914}}.
The Reno and Cubic congestion control algorithms
do not address it, but a new congestion control algorithm
has the opportunity to improve the state of the art.

### Protection Against High Packet Loss

A congestion control algorithm should try to avoid causing excessively high rates of packet loss.
To accomplish this, it should avoid excessive increases in sending rate, and reduce its
sending rate if experiencing high packet loss.

The first version of the BBR algorithm {{BBRv1-draft}} failed this requirement.
Experimental evaluation {{BBRv1-Evaluation}} showed that
it caused a sustained rate of packet loss
when multiple BBRv1 flows shared a bottleneck and the buffer size was
less than roughly one and a half BDP.
This kind of behavior needed to be fixed, and indeed
further versions of BBR {{BBR-draft}}
fixed this issue.

This requirement does not imply that the algorithm should react to
packet losses in exactly the same way as current standards-track congestion
control algorithms (e.g., {{!RFC5681}}).

### Fairness within the Proposed Congestion Control Algorithm

When multiple competing flows all use the same
proposed congestion control algorithm, the proposal should
explore how the capacity is shared among the competing flows.
Capacity fairness can be important when a small number of similar
flows compete to fill a bottleneck. It can however also not be useful,
for example, when comparing flows that seek to send at different rates or
when some of the flows do not last sufficiently long to approach
asymptotic behavior.

### Short Flows {#short-flows}

A great deal of congestion control analysis concerns the steady-state behavior
of long flows. However, many Internet flows are relatively short-lived. If flows
never experience a packet loss, a short-lived flow remains in the "slow start" mode of
operation {{?RFC5681}} that commonly features exponential congestion window growth.

A proposed congestion control algorithm MUST consider how new and short-lived flows affect long-lived flows,
and vice versa.

## Mixed Algorithm Behavior

These criteria evaluate the interaction of the
proposed congestion control algorithm with commonly deployed
congestion control algorithms.

In contexts where differing congestion control
algorithms are used, it is important to understand whether
the proposed congestion control algorithm could result in more
harm than previous standards-track algorithms (e.g. {{!RFC5681}},
{{!RFC9002}}, {{!RFC9438}}) to flows sharing a common bottleneck.
The measure of harm is not restricted to the equality
of capacity, but ought also to consider metrics such as the
introduced latency, or an increase in packet loss. An evaluation must
assess the potential to cause starvation, including assurance that
a loss of all feedback (e.g., detected by expiry of a retransmission time out)
results in backoff.

### Existing General-Purpose Transports

A proposed congestion control algorithm SHOULD be evaluated when
competing using standard IETF congestion controls, e.g. {{!RFC5681}},
{{!RFC9002}}, {{!RFC9438}}.
A proposed congestion control algorithm
that has a significantly negative impact on
flows using standard congestion control might be suspect and this aspect should
be part of the community's decision making with regards to the suitability of
the proposed congestion control algorithm. The community should also consider
other non-standard congestion control algorithms that are known to be widely deployed.

Note that this guideline is not a requirement for strict Reno- or Cubic-
friendliness as a prerequisite for a proposed congestion
control mechanism to advance to Experimental or Standards Track status.
As an example,
HighSpeed TCP is a congestion control mechanism specified as
Experimental, that is not TCP-friendly in all environments.
When a new congestion control algorithm is deployed, the existing major deployments need to be
considered to avoid severe performance degradation.
We also note that this guideline does not constrain the interaction with
non-best-effort flows.

As an example from an Experimental RFC, fairness with standard TCP is discussed
in Sections 4 and 6 of {{?RFC3649}} (HighSpeed TCP) and using spare capacity is
discussed in Sections 6, 11.1, and 12 of {{?RFC3649}}.

### Real-Time Protocols

General-purpose protocols need to coexist in the Internet with real-time congestion
control algorithms, which, in general, have finite throughput requirements (i.e.
do not seek to utilize all available capacity) and more strict latency
bounds.

{{?RFC8868}} provides suggestions for real-time congestion control design and
{{?RFC8867}} suggests test cases. {{?RFC9392}} describes some considerations
for the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). In particular, feedback for real-time
flows can be less frequent than the acknowledgements provided by reliable
transports. This document does not change the informational status of those
RFCs.

A proposed congestion control algorithm SHOULD consider coexistence with widely deployed real-time
congestion control algorithms. Regrettably, at the time of writing (2024), many algorithms with
detailed public specifications are not widely deployed, while many widely
deployed real-time congestion control algorithms have incomplete public specifications.
It is hoped this situation will change.

To the extent that behavior of widely deployed algorithms is understood,
a proposed congestion control algorithm
can analyze and simulate their interaction with those algorithms. To the
extent they are not, experiments can be conducted where possible.

Real-time flows can be directed into distinct
queues via Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCP) or other mechanisms,
which can substantially reduce the interplay with other traffic. However, a proposal
targeting general Internet use can not assume this is always the case.

### Short and Long Flows

The effect on short-lived and long-lived flows using other common congestion
control algorithms MUST be evaluated, as in {{short-flows}}.

## Other Criteria

### Differences with Congestion Control Principles

Proposed congestion control algorithms SHOULD include a clear
explanation of any deviations from {{!RFC2914}} and {{!RFC7141}}.

### Incremental Deployment

The proposed congestion control algorithm ought to discuss whether it
allows for incremental deployment in the
targeted environment.  For a mechanism targeted for deployment in
the current Internet, it would be helpful for the proposal to
discuss what is known (if anything) about the correct operation
of the mechanisms with some of the equipment that can be installed in the
current Internet, e.g., routers, transparent proxies, WAN
optimizers, intrusion detection systems, home routers, and the
like.

As a similar concern, if the proposed congestion control algorithm
is intended only for specific environments (and not the
global Internet), the proposal should consider how this intention
is to be realised.  The community will have to address the
question of whether the scope can be enforced by stating
the restrictions or whether additional protocol mechanisms are
required to enforce this scoping.  The answer will necessarily
depend on the change that is being proposed.

As an example from an Experimental RFC, deployment issues are
discussed in Sections 10.3 and 10.4 of {{?RFC4782}} (Quick-Start).

# General Use {#general-use}

The criteria in {{evaluation-criteria}} will be evaluated in the
following scenarios.
Unless a proposed congestion control algorithm
explicitly forbids use on the
public Internet, the community MUST find that it meets the criteria
in these scenarios for the proposed congestion control algorithm to progress.

The evaluation in each scenario should occur over a representative range of
bandwidths, delays, and queue depths. Of course, the set of parameters
representative of the public Internet will change over time.

These criteria are intended to capture a statistically dominant set of Internet
conditions. In the case that a proposed congestion control algorithm
has been tested at Internet scale,
the results from that deployment are often useful for answering these questions.

## Paths with Tail-drop Queues

The performance of a congestion control algorithm is affected by the queue discipline applied at
the bottleneck link. The drop-tail queue discipline (using a FIFO buffer) MUST be evaluated.
See {{aqm}} for evaluation of other queue
disciplines.

## Tunnel Behavior

When a proposed congestion control algorithm relies on explicit signals from the path, the proposal
MUST consider the effect of
traffic passing through a tunnel, where routers may not be aware of the
flow.

## Wired Paths

Wired networks are usually characterized by extremely low rates of packet loss except
for those due to queue drops. They tend to have stable aggregate bandwidth,
usually higher than other types of links, and low non-queueing delay. Because
the properties are relatively simple, wired links are typically used as a
"baseline" case even if they are not always the bottleneck link in the modern
Internet.

## Wireless Paths

While the early Internet was dominated by wired links, the properties
of wireless links have become extremely important to Internet performance.
In particular, a proposed congestion control algorithm should be evaluated in situations
where some packet losses are due to radio effects, rather than router
queue drops; the link capacity varies over time due to changing link conditions;
and media access delays and link-layer retransmission lead to increased jitter
in round-trip times. See {{?RFC3819}} and Section 16 of {{Tools}} for further
discussion of wireless properties.

# Special Cases {#special-cases}

The criteria in {{evaluation-criteria}} will be evaluated in the
following scenarios, unless the proposed congestion control
algorithm specifically excludes its use in a
scenario. For these specific use-cases, the community
MAY allow a proposal to progress even if the criteria
indicate an unsatisfactory result for these scenarios.

In general, measurements from Internet-scale deployments might not expose the
properties of operation in each of these scenarios, because they are not as
ubiquitous as the General Use scenarios.

## Active Queue Management (AQM) {#aqm}

The proposed congestion control algorithm SHOULD be evaluated under a variety of bottleneck queue disciplines.
The effect of an AQM discipline can be hard to detect by Internet evaluation.
At a minimum, a proposal should reason about an algorithm's response to various
AQM disciplines. Simulation or empirical results are, of course, valuable.

Among the AQM techniques that might have an impact on a proposed congestion control
algorithm are FQ-CoDel {{?RFC8290}}; Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced
(PIE) {{?RFC8033}}; and Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S)
{{?RFC9332}}.

A proposed congestion control algorithm that sets one of the two Explicit Congestion Transport (ECT)
codepoints in the IP header can gain the benefits of receiving Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
Congestion Experienced (CE) signals from an on-path AQM {{?RFC8087}}.
Use of ECN {{?RFC3168}},{{?RFC9332}} results in requirements for
the congestion control algorithm to react when it receives a packet with an ECN-CE marking.
This reaction needs to be evaluated to confirm that the algorithm conforms with the
requirements of the ECT codepoint that was used.

Note that evaluation of AQM techniques -- as opposed to their impact on a specific
proposed congestion control algorithm -- is out of scope of this document. {{?RFC7567}}
describes design considerations for AQMs.

## Paths with Varying Delay {#delay}

An Internet Path can include simple links, where the minimum delay is the propagation delay,
and any additional delay can be attributed to link buffering. This cannot be assumed.
An Internet Path can also include complex subnetworks where the minimum delay changes over
various time scales, resulting in a non-stationary minimum delay.

This occurs when a subnet changes the forwarding path to optimise capacity, resilience, etc.
It could also arise when a subnet uses a capacity management method where the available
resource is periodically distributed among the active nodes and where a node might then
have to buffer data until an assigned transmission opportunity or when the physical path
changes (e.g., when the length of a wireless path changes, or the physical layer changes
its mode of operation).
Variation also arises when a higher priority diffserv traffic classic prompts the
transmission by a lower class. In these cases, the delay varies as a function of
external factors and attempting to infer congestion from an increase in the delay
results in reduced throughput. The jitter from variation over short timescales
might not be distinguishable similar from other effects.

A proposed congestion control algorithm SHOULD be evaluated to ensure their operation is robust
when there is a significant change in the minimum delay.

## Internet of Things

The "Internet of Things" (IoT) is a broad concept, but when evaluating
a proposed congestion control algorithm,
it is often associated with unique characteristics.

IoT nodes might be more constrained in power, CPU, or other parameters than
conventional Internet hosts. This might place limits on the complexity of any
given algorithm. These power and radio constraints might make the volume of
control packets in a given algorithm a key evaluation metric.

Furthermore, many IoT applications do not a have a human in the loop, and
therefore can have weaker latency constraints because they do not relate to a user
experience, but still need to share the path with other flows with different
constraints.

Extremely low-power links can lead to very low throughput and a low bandwidth-
delay product, well below the standard operating range of most Internet flows.

## Paths with High Delay

A proposed congestion control algorithm ought not to presume that all general Internet paths have a low
delay.
Some paths include links that contibute much more delay than for a typical Internet path.
Satellite links often have delays longer than typical for wired paths
{{?RFC2488}} and high delay bandwidth products {{?RFC3649}}.
Also, many systems
use dynamic capacity assignment that can result in variation of the delay
and the capacity over timescales of the order of the path RTT.
Robustness to delay and delay variation may be a key evaluation metric.

## Misbehaving Nodes

A proposed congestion control algorithm should explore
how the algorithm performs with non-compliant senders, receivers, or
routers.  In addition, the proposal should explore how a
proposed congestion control algorithm performs with outside
attackers.  This can be particularly important for proposed congestion control algorithms
that involve explicit feedback from routers
along the path.

As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance with
misbehaving nodes and outside attackers is discussed in Sections
9.4, 9.5, and 9.6 of {{?RFC4782}} (Quick-Start).  This includes
discussion of misbehaving senders and receivers; collusion
between misbehaving routers; misbehaving middleboxes; and the
potential use of Quick-Start to attack routers or to tie up
available Quick-Start bandwidth.

## Extreme Packet Reordering

A proposed congestion control algorithm ought not to presume that all general
Internet paths reliably deliver
packets in order. {{?RFC4653}} discusses the effect of extreme packet reordering.

## Transient Events

A proposed congestion control algorithm SHOULD
consider how the proposed congestion control
algorithm would perform in the presence of transient events such
as sudden onset of congestion, a routing change, or a mobility event.
Routing changes, link disconnections, intermittent link
connectivity, and mobility are discussed in more detail in
Section 16 of {{Tools}}.

As an example from an Experimental RFC, response to transient
events is discussed in Section&nbsp;9.2 of {{?RFC4782}} (Quick-Start).

### Sudden changes in the Path

An IETF transport is not tied to a specific Internet path or type of path.
The set of routers that form a path can and do change with time,
this will cause the properties of the path to change with respect to time.
A proposed congestion control algorithm
MUST evaluate the impact of changes in the path, and be robust
to changes in path characteristics on the interval of common Internet re-routing intervals.

Even when the set of routers constituting a path does not change, the properties of
that path can vary with time (e.g., due to a change of link capacity,
relative priority, or a change
in the rate of other flows sharing a bottleneck), with a potential impact on the
operation of a congestion control algorithm.

## Multipath Transport

Multipath transport protocols permit more than one path to be differentiated and used by
a single connection at the sender.
A multipath sender can schedule which packets travel on which of its active paths.
This enables a tradeoff in timeliness and reliability. There are various ways that
multipath techniques can be used.

One example use is to provide fail-over from one path to
another when the original path is no longer viable or to switch the traffic from
one path to another when this is expected to improve performance
(latency, throughput, reliability, cost).
Designs need to independently track the congestion state of each path,
and need to demonstrate independent congestion control for each path being used.
Authors of a proposed multipath congestion control algorithm that implements path fail-over MUST evaluate the harm resulting
from a change in the path, and show that this does not result in flow starvation.
Synchronisation of failover (e.g., where multiple flows change their path on similar
timeframes) can also contribute to harm and/or reduce fairness,
these effects also ought to be evaluated.

Another example use is concurrent multipath, where the transport protocol simultaneously
schedules flows to aggregate the capacity across multiple paths.

The Internet provides no guarantee that different paths
(e.g., using different endpoint addresses) are disjoint.
This has additional implications:
A proposed congestion control algorithm MUST evaluate the potential
harm to other flows when the multiple paths share a common
congested bottleneck
(or share resources that are coupled between different paths,
such as an overall capacity limit), and SHOULD consider
the potential for harm to other flows. Synchronisation of congestion control mechanisms
(e.g., where multiple flows change their behaviour on similar
timeframes) can also contribute to harm and/or reduce fairness,
these effects also ought to be evaluated.

At the time of writing (2024), there are currently no Standards Track RFCs, but there is an Experimental RFC {{?RFC6356}} that specifies
a concurrent multipath congestion control algorithm for TCP (MPTCP {{?RFC8684}}).

## Data Centers

Data centers are characterized by very low latencies (< 2 ms). Many workloads
involve bursty traffic where many nodes complete a task at the same time. As a
controlled environment, data centers often deploy fabrics that employ rich
signalling from switches to endpoints. Furthermore, the operator can often limit
the number of operating congestion controls.

For these reasons, data center congestion controls are often distinct from those
running elsewhere on the Interenet.  A proposed congestion control need not
coexist well with all other algorithms if it is intended for data centers, but
the proposal SHOULD indicate which are expected to safely coexist with it.

# Security Considerations

This document does not represent a change to any aspect of the TCP/IP
protocol suite and therefore does not directly impact Internet
security.  The implementation of various facets of the Internet's
current congestion control algorithms do have security implications
(e.g., as outlined in {{!RFC5681}}).

The IETF process that results in publication needs to
ensure that these security implications are considered.
Proposed congestion control algorithms therefore ought to be mindful of pitfalls, and should
examine any potential security issues that may arise.
